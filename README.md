  ## Description
          
  This project is to create a NoSQL database using MongoDB. This database will house users, thoughts, and reactions. The application will resemble modern social media platforms. I will show it's functionality using insomnia in this tutorial video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wFCc9YyB4K1NMHFLQ1gi5LaW3gDm7sCY/view . The users may upload their thoughts to this platform as well as react to the thoughts of others. They can even befriend eachother using this app. Enjoy!
